    #* This is a multi-line comment.
       It can span multiple lines.
       Keywords like start or loop inside here should be ignored.
       Operators like +-/* should also be ignored.

    #* Error: Unclosed multi-line comment.
       This tests the specific error for comments that lack the closing tag.
       Because it never closes, the scanner should flag it as an error 
       when it reaches the EOF.
